# Task 06 – Deep Fake (AI Street Interview)

## Overview
This project is part of **SU OPT Research Task 06**.  
The goal was to transform prior IPL dataset analysis (Task 05 – Descriptive Statistics & LLM Analysis) into an **AI-generated "street interview"** using free or student-friendly tools.  

The emphasis is less on the polished output and more on documenting the **workflow, experiments, and tools** used in the process.

## Workflow Summary
1. **Script Writing**  
   - Created a conversational Q&A script with an interviewer and fan based on IPL insights.  
   - Stored under `/scripts/interview_script.txt`.  

2. **Tool Exploration**  
   - Attempted D-ID → limited free plan (10 words only).  
   - Switched to **Coqui TTS** → generated full audio.  
   - Edited with **Canva/CapCut** → added background video and subtitles.  

3. **Final Output**
